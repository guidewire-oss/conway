# AGENTS.md — project instructions for opencode, Claude Code, Codex, and other coding agents

## Project

This project uses the software factory scaffold (`opencode.json`, `.opencode/`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`). Project-specific enforcement values (protected paths, test patterns, docs root, citation prefix) live in `factory.yaml` — hooks read it at runtime; never hardcode these in a hook.

## Long-term rules

### Always verify the latest version of any tool, library, or framework against its authoritative source — never rely on training data alone

When the task touches versions, release notes, current APIs, or "the latest" anything, **search the web first** (via `webfetch` on the official docs/release page). Training-data priors go stale. The rule:

- **Tool version:** fetch the official release page (e.g. `https://go.dev/doc/devel/release`, `https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/releases`) and cite the version + date.
- **API surface:** fetch the actual doc, not a recollection of it. If a citation is load-bearing, the citation-lint will catch a miss at CI time — but the goal is to never generate the miss in the first place.
- **Doc citations:** when citing a spec doc by file and line, resolve the line against the actual file in this repo before asserting it says something.

### Honesty about what you don't recognize

If a tool, library, or concept is named that you don't recognize, **say so explicitly** before guessing. Do not confabulate a plausible-sounding answer. The cost of "I don't recognize that — let me search" is minutes; the cost of a fabricated citation discovered in review is trust, and the cost of shipping one is paid by every user downstream.

### When you finish a task, do what was actually asked

If the user asks you to research and write findings to a doc, write the doc. Don't stop at the chat summary. Delivering a full synthesis in chat but never writing it to the file the user asked for is a real failure mode — don't repeat it.

## Working conventions

- **Spec source is the source of truth.** Every decision goes in the decision log (or an ADR) before code, not after.
- **No emojis in files** unless the user explicitly asks.
- **No internal context in the repo or its comms.** Examples, fixtures, test
  data, spec scenarios, lessons, commit messages, and PR text MUST use generic
  names (the demo plan's Atlas/Beacon vocabulary, `PROJ` issue keys, "a 29×35
  reference plan") — never internal project names, initiative/pod names, Jira
  keys, or internal hostnames. This repo is public-facing; write every
  artifact as if an outsider will read it, because one can.
- **Language conventions come from the installed pack** (`packs/<language>/pack.yaml`): blessed test stack, linters, security scanners. Re-verify tool versions against their release pages before pinning — never pin from memory.
- **Workflow recipes live in `workflows/`.** When a task matches one — a review, an eval, a fan-out over many files — read the recipe and run its graph with whatever orchestration this harness has (Claude Code workflows, opencode subagents, Codex `spawn_agent`): fan out where nodes are independent, put a verifier before findings count, and keep plumbing (dedupe, merge) as deterministic code, not an agent. `scripts/hooks/workflow-lint.sh` enforces that shape. See `docs/WORKFLOWS.md`.

## Factory rules — enforced by CI hooks, not by this file

The factory has computational controls that enforce invariants at CI time. You do not need to memorize these rules — the hooks catch violations regardless. But you should know they exist, so you understand why CI fails when it does. The full rules and their enforcement mechanisms are documented in `docs/FACTORY_RULES.md`. Read that file when working on the factory itself (hooks, agents, scripts, CI), not when writing product code.

Key hooks you will encounter in CI failures:
- `scripts/citation-lint.sh` — resolves `<citation_prefix>*.md:NN` citations against `docs_root` (both configured in `factory.yaml`; empty prefix disables)
- `docs/examples/hooks/field-coverage-check.sh` — an example domain-invariant hook; copy and adapt it for structs whose fields must never silently escape a derived computation
- `scripts/hooks/shared-script-enforcement.sh` — verifies opencode, Claude Code, and Codex adapters call shared scripts, not inline logic
- `scripts/hooks/test-edit-denial.sh` — blocks the implementer role from editing `*_test.go`
- `scripts/hooks/ginkgo-only-check.sh` — permits `testing` only in `RunSpecs` bootstraps; all behavioral tests use Ginkgo/Gomega
- `scripts/hooks/commit-message-lint.sh` — conventional commits, max 6 bullets <=25 words each, no bare "verified" claim without command+output evidence (see `memory/lessons/001-verification-contract.md`)
- `scripts/hooks/direct-main-push-block.sh` — rejects direct pushes to `main`; push a feature branch and open an App-authored PR

### Write-time rules (not enforceable by hooks — must be in context)

- **Cite spec docs by `file:line`** in code comments and PR descriptions. The citation-lint checks that the file and line exist; it does not check that you cited the right line. That's your job.
- **The Verification Contract — you may only claim what you have observed.** Three levels: WROTE (no evidence), RAN (executed the check this session, pasted output), OBSERVED (saw it happen at the system level). Only RAN and OBSERVED may use "fixed"/"verified"/"works". Every "verified" line must cite the exact command and paste its real output. If you did not run it, write "written but NOT verified." "All N items fixed" is N independent claims — any item without evidence must be listed separately as NOT verified. Full contract in `docs/FACTORY_RULES.md`.
- **Protected paths (factory.yaml `protected_paths`) are permanently human-reviewed.** Every diff is reviewed line-by-line; no auto-merge, ever. CODEOWNERS enforces this at merge time; you enforce it by writing code that survives line-by-line review.
- **`FACTORY_AGENT_ROLE` must be set explicitly at the enforcement point.** The default is unset (allow). Only `implementer` is denied test-file edits. OpenCode derives the role from the session; Claude and Codex adapters must inject it from role-specific hook configuration.
- **Second-brain loop-close (Karpathy pattern).** At session end, write any lesson worth keeping to `memory/lessons/NNN-*.md` with provenance (the exact source: file:line, fetched URL + date, or "observed YYYY-MM-DD via <action>"). Lessons summarize and point; they never fork canon. A lesson without provenance is worse than no lesson — it becomes a stale fact asserted with confidence (the project's known scar tissue). The wiki (`wiki/`) is the agent-maintained query layer; your spec source (the `docs_root` in `factory.yaml`) and the ADRs stay the source of truth. A wiki page that restates them will drift into a second truth.
- **Loop-close nudge (two-layer trigger).** The opencode plugin writes `memory/.pending-lesson-reminder` on every `session.idle` event (after each agent turn). At the start of your next turn, if this file exists: reflect on whether the previous turn revealed a non-obvious fact (gotcha, version mismatch, API shape, bug fix that cost time). If so, write `memory/lessons/NNN-*.md` with provenance. Delete the flag file regardless. At process exit, the `dispose` hook calls `scripts/hooks/loop-close-check.sh` — if files changed but no lessons were written, it writes `memory/PENDING-LESSONS.md` as a reminder. These are nudges, not enforcement; the agent-discipline rule above is the backstop.
- **Agent-authored PRs declare their provenance** with two trailers in the PR body: `Agent-Runtime: <opencode|claude-code|codex>` and `Agent-Role: <spec-writer|implementer|refactorer|reviewer|wiki-maintainer>`. This costs one line and lets any audit or governance tooling attribute the work without guessing.

## Working agreement

Before continuing, name the deliverable in one sentence (PR title, file changed, command output you expect). Stop and check with me if (a) you spend more than 10 minutes without an edit, or (b) the same approach fails twice. Do not retry past two attempts on any single fix.

## Specs

Specs live in this repo under `specs/`, one file per feature. They do **not**
live in a sibling specs repository — that convention does not apply here.

- **Format:** follow `specs/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md` (local copy of
  <https://github.com/anoop2811/ai-craft/blob/main/SPEC_TEMPLATE.md>). Use its
  section order and numbering as written.
- **File naming:** `NNN-kebab-case-name.md`, numbered so specs can be
  cross-referenced by ID (`001-plan-execution-order.md`).
- **Requirements say WHAT and WHY.** Algorithms, alternatives considered, and
  their consequences belong in §11 Decision Record, not in the requirement
  tables.
- **Mark unknowns** `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` in §10 rather than assuming.
- Keep specs alive: they are the decision record for why the code is shaped the
  way it is. Tests capture what the system does.

`SPEC.md` (v1 prototype model), `GAME-SPEC.md` and `docs/v2-spec.md` predate
this convention and stay where they are; new feature specs go in `specs/`.
