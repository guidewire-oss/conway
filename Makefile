# Core factory targets — language-agnostic. Language packs contribute their
# own test/lint/build targets via packs/<language>/Makefile.pack at init time.

# Conway's own task interface (build, test, server, stop, status, logs, clean).
# factory-init replaces this file wholesale, so if `make build` disappears after
# an install or upgrade, this is the line to put back.

# its tests passed — it only meant the factory's own machinery was intact.

# thing it exists to do. If a gate cannot run here (no origin/main in a fresh
# clone, say), fetch it rather than ignoring the result.
